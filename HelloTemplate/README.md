## Hello Template

This example is a simple "Hello World" Gtk application using an XML template. 
It is inspired by the Vala project template generated by GNOME Builder.

The ui resource files are located in the `src/main/resources/` folder. They 
need to be compiled with `glib-compile-resources` before they can be used. The 
Gradle build script is configured to run `glib-compile-resources` before the 
Java code is compiled and run, so please make sure the Gtk development tools 
are installed.

The application can be built and run using `gradle run`.

### Flatpak installation

The example can be installed as a Flatpak application.

First, install the required Flatpak runtimes:
```shell
flatpak --user install org.gnome.Platform//47 org.gnome.Sdk//47 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.openjdk//24.08
```

Run the following shell commands:

```shell
gradle flatpakGradleGenerator
flatpak-builder --user --install build/flatpak flatpak/my.example.HelloTemplate.json
```

The first command scans the Gradle build for online dependencies, and generates 
a JSON file with all dependency URLs. The second command runs `flatpak-builder`. 
The Flatpak build script can be found in the `flatpak/` folder. It includes the 
generated JSON file (so the dependencies will be downloaded) and then runs 
`gradle installDist`. When done, you can run the application:

```shell
flatpak run my.example.HelloTemplate
```
