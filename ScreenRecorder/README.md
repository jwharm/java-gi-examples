## Screen Recorder

This example is a basic X11 screen recorder using GStreamer using the `ximagesrc` plugin and ogg/theora output. It also implements a Tee that streams data to an AppSink, to demonstrate performing custom actions on the buffer data.

To run the example, clone the repository, navigate to the `ScreenRecorder` folder, and execute `gradle run`.
