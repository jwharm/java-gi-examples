## Media Stream

This example is a simple Gtk application that draws images using Cairo inside a GtkMediaStream. It is 
ported from the GtkDemo "Media Stream" example (in the "Paintable" category).

To run the example, clone the repository, navigate to the `MediaStream` folder, and execute `gradle run`.
