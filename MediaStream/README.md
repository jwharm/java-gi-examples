## Media Stream

This example is a simple Gtk application that draws images using Cairo inside a GtkMediaStream. It is 
ported from the GtkDemo "Media Stream" example (in the "Paintable" category). To draw the graphics, the [Cairo Java bindings](https://github.com/jwharm/cairo-java-bindings) are used.

To run the example, clone the repository, navigate to the `MediaStream` folder, and execute `gradle run`.
